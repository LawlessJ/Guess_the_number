					------Guess the number!!------
requires: Python 3.7 (utilizes input function)
This code makes use of the random and time modules.

This script can be executed from your computer terminal. Navigate the terminal to the working directory you downloaded the file in, then input:
>>python3 guess_the_number.py
to execute the script.

This is a simple guessing game. The computer will randomly select a number between a limited range (to be determined by the difficulty selected by the user). The user then inputs their guess, and the computer will indicate whether or not the guess was too high, too low, or correct. After guessing correctly, the user can choose to play again or quit.
